* the Commodore VIC-20

* the Commodore C64
* the Atari 800XL

It is not suitable for the Commodore C128
# BOM Value
The BOM value of Rev. 1, without the 3D printed case and label is 9.50â‚¬ (01.11.2021, values obtained from Reichelt.de). The Lumberg connectors are more expensive from other suppliers.

# Rev. 2
The Lumberg BTOR1 RCA jacks were obsolete and replaced with CUI Inc. RCJ-02*. This also requires a different bottom shell of the 3D-printed case. There are Keystome RCA jacks, that fit the same footprint (they are more expensive). See the BOM Rev. 2
